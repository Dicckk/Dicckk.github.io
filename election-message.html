		<h1>A message from Dave</h1>
		<p class="text-muted">Taken from his speech on the 12th February 2022 in Castle Vale</p>
		<hr />

<p>I'd like to tell you a bit about myself - We haven't got much time so, it won't be modest.</p>
<p>I have been a councillor for 18 years, an MP in Coventry for nine years, and I then worked at the Citizens Advice Bureau for 20 years, solving people's welfare rights, debt and housing problems.</p>
<p>So, it's unlikely that I haven't already dealt with the problems people bring to MPs - and I think I can do an excellent job for you.</p>

<hr />

<p>In Parliament, I was one of the first MPs to bring in a private member's bill to establish a national minimum wage.</p>
<p>I won changes in the law to allow thousands of families with severely disabled babies Disability Living Allowance.</p>
<p>I fought for better rights in the workplace, including extending health and safety law to oil rigs and other offshore workers.</p>
<p>And I led the parliamentary opposition when 18 million people refused to pay the Poll Tax, which forced Margaret Thatcher's resignation in November 1990.</p>
<p><b>All whilst I was in opposition and in 1991, I was voted by journalists as the Backbencher of the Year</b>.</p>

<hr />

<p>But for opposing the Poll Tax and the imprisonment of pensioners who couldn't pay the poll tax, I was expelled from the Labour Party 30 years ago.</p>
<p><b>Expelled because I thought it was better to break that law than break the Poor.</b></p>

<hr />

<p><b>And I'm not doing it for the money</b><p>
<p>MPs are currently on <b>£82,000 a year</b> - I think they're paid too much!</p>
<p>I think that when a new gas and electric bill drops on your doormat in April, and it's £700 more than you're paying at the moment, it will feel a lot different to working families in Castle Vale than an MP on three times the average wage of people in Birmingham!</p>
<p><b>MPs are insulated from day to day problems. They don't feel them as ordinary people do.</b></p>
<p>So, in the 1980s, when I was last an MP, my family and I took an average skilled factory wage in Coventry - less than half an MPs wage. The rest I donated to campaigns and strike funds and things that benefit local people and their communities. If elected next Thursday, I will do the same again.</p>
<p>But that's not the only reason I'm asking you to vote for me next Thursday.</p>

<hr />

<p>I'm standing because if either of my main two opponents in this election were elected, it wouldn't make a bit of difference in working people's lives.</p>
<p>If the <b style="color:blue">Tory</b> candidate wins, Boris Johnson will still have an 80 seat majority in Parliament, and the Tories will carry on attacking working people.</p>
<p>If the <b style="color:red">Labour</b> candidate were elected on 3rd March, it wouldn't make any fundamental difference - Just look at her main campaign promises:
<ul>
<li>Regenerate our high streets</li>
<li>Tackle crime and antisocial behaviour</li>
<li>Crackdown on rogue landlords</li>
<li>Bring in jobs and investment</li>
</ul>

<p><b>All very important issues – but they are all things the Birmingham Labour Council should already be doing now!</b></p>

<p>And Paulette Hamilton, the Labour candidate, is paid £41,000 a year to be one of the leaders of Birmingham Council. If she's doing nothing to tackle those problems as a councillor - <b>why would she be any different as an MP?</b></p>

<p>In fact, it's worse than that. On £41,000 a year, Paulette Hamilton was the Cabinet Member who tried to cut the hours and wages of the low paid, mainly women workers on Birmingham Council in the Home Care service.</p>

<hr />

<p><b>We need someone who will fight to raise workers' wages, not cut them!</b></p>
<p>And we also need someone who would fight to save jobs - Birmingham Labour Council has had cuts from the Tory Government, but instead of fighting back, it has cut 13,000 jobs in the last ten years - which is why local services are getting worse.</p>
<p>And Labour hasn't been prepared to mount a fierce campaign to save the jobs we already have. They should have demanded, as I would do, the nationalisation of firms like GKN threatening to close factories and send jobs abroad.</li>
<p>The Tories have been forced to do that before - most recently with an engineering firm in Sheffield last October - and with a determined campaign, the government could be forced to save jobs like that again.</li>
<p>So we will fight for those things as and when they come up</p>
<p><b>I won't be a manager like my main two opponents in this election</b> - who act as different wings of the same Establishment, but a shop steward who acts on behalf of working people and their families whether in workplaces or in local communities.</p>

<hr />

<p><b>We need to send an independent voice to Parliament</b> to challenge that Establishment and seriously fight for working-class people.</p>
<p>But we also need to send an MP who can face up to the big challenges that face all of us.</p>

<hr />

<p><b>This country has changed in the last 50 years</b> - as a small number of millionaires, now billionaires, at the top have persuaded politicians of all parties to rig the system in their favour.</p>
<p>When I was growing up in the 1950s and 60s, one skilled wage could buy you a house. Jane first bought a house at 21.</p>
<p><b>Young people today face house prices eight or ten times their annual wage - for many, it's impossible now to get a mortgage.</b></p>
<p>We need decent homes for all people – and mandatory control over landlords and rents.</p>

<hr />

<p>In the 1960s, education was free. About 1500 young people from Erdington will go to university later this year and come back with debt three years later of £50,000.</p>
<p><b>We want to see the abolition of fees and loans, and a return to free education.</b></p>

<hr />

<p>But half the 18-year-olds don't go to university.</p> 
<p>With unemployment in Birmingham at 12.5% -  2.5 times the national average - it's also hard to get a job at a decent rate of pay.</p>
<p><b>Many young people will end up in insecure and temporary contracts, on a minimum wage on which you can barely exist.</b></p>
<p>We fight for a £15 an hour minimum wage and for services and industries to be reconstructed to give our young people a decent job and a stake in the future.</p>

<hr />

<p>And it's not only young people who are facing a different world.</p>
<p><b>Working people are being hit with horrific price rises.</b> Gas and electricity prices went up by £139 last October; they are due to go up by £700 in April; and there is a further price rise coming in October. That'll be £1000 in total.</p>
<p>In her fifth election promise, the Labour candidate says she is:</p>
<p class="quote">"backing Labour's plan for a cut in that bill of £200."</p>
<p>The Tories say they are more generous. They're offering £350, but £200 of that is a loan you will have to pay back!</p>
<p><b>Why should we pay any price rise? In the last ten years, big oil and gas companies have paid £200 billion in dividends to their shareholders.</b></p>
<p>These essential industries should be publicly owned and democratically controlled. And those profits should be used to cut people's bills and invest in a quicker move to clean, green energy.</p>

<hr />

<p>And it's not just energy. <b>Food is rocketing in price for many families</b>, forcing a choice between food or fuel and increasing the use of food banks. </p>

<hr />

<p>Some of those hardest hit will be our pensioners. Or those living on inadequate state benefits.</p>
<p><b>We have one of the worst rates of state retirement pension of almost any country in Europe.</b></p>
<p>The maximum currently in the UK is £180. It's £212 in the Netherlands. £254 in Germany and in Denmark, it's £360 a week!</p>
<p>If elected, I would fight for a 50% increase in pensions and benefits. So working people who are unable to work, or have gone past working age, can have a decent life.</p>

<hr />

<p>To find the money for such an increase, we need to restructure the economy in a socialist direction.</p>
<p>We are the fifth richest country on the planet. When the banks crashed 14 years ago, the government found £400 billion to rescue them. They spent the same again supporting businesses during the pandemic.</p>
<p>Britain's 171 billionaires are worth over £500 billion.</p>
<p><b>It's not that we are short of money to change people's lives for the better - it's that the money isn't evenly shared in society.</b></p>
<p>It's in too few hands.</p>

<hr />

<p><b>Our NHS needs investment - We were not prepared for this pandemic.</b></p>
<p>In January 2020, Britain had 4000 intensive care beds, while Germany had 27,000.</p>
<p>A decade of wage freezes in the public sector means we have 100,000 unfilled jobs in our hospitals, and nurses – nurses! - using food banks!</p>
<p>Six million people are on waiting lists and the Tory government wants to give more work to the private sector to reduce those lists.</p>
<p><b>We argue that the NHS should take over the private sector</b>, pharmaceutical and medical equipment manufacturers, and run all of it for the public good - not for private profit.</p>
<p>Social care should be free and staffed by well-trained, properly paid people.</p>
<p><b>Prescriptions should be free in England - as they are in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.</b></p>
<p>And by the way, the Tories are about to announce that everyone between the ages of 60 to 66 who currently do get free prescriptions will lose them!</p>

<hr />

<p>When the Tories or Labour say "<i>we can't afford all that…</i>": decent homes, jobs on decent wages, bills we can afford</p>

<p>We say: We're not a poor country. We're a very wealthy country. But the wrong people have got the money.</p>
<p><b>We need to change society so that the wealth produced by working people is owned and controlled by them.</b></p>

<hr />

<p>So that's why I'm standing in this election.</p>
<p><b>Without a socialist in the debates, the main establishment parties will just discuss how working people should pay for the crisis, in higher prices or fewer services.</b></p>
<p>Socialists demand that working people shouldn't pay for a crisis they haven't caused.</p><!--edit-->

<hr />

<p><b>Many people are disillusioned with politicians</b> - and I don't blame them </p>
<p>People feel nobody speaks for them. </p>
<p class="quote">"All politicians are the same"</p>
<p class="quote">"Once they get down to London, they forget about the people who sent them there"</p>
<p class="quote">"They're only in it for themselves"</p>

<p>So because of that, barely half the people in Erdington vote for any politician at a general election. </p>
<p><b>I'm not blaming them. They can't see anybody from any established party that will make any real difference in their lives.</b></p>
<p>I think we are different. We have radical socialist policies that could make a real change in people's lives.</p>
<p>We are not in it for the money - our public representatives only take the same wage as the people they represent.</p>
<p>But one new MP or one new councillor is only a first step.</p>
<p>We need you to get involved and help us in this election and the council elections in May. And to help us build a new party for working people rooted in the organisations and communities of the working class</p>
<p><b>I only make one more promise:<br />I won't let you down.</b></p>
<p>Thanks for listening.</p>
