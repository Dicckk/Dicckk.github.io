<h1>One rule for the Tories and another for us.</h1>
<h3><b>But our voice is never heard.</b></h3>
<h5>That's why Dave Nellist – the socialist former MP who gave away half his wages – is standing in the Erdington by-election to speak up for us.</h5>
<hr />

<p>For 12 years, the Tories have waged war on working-class people. But where is the opposition? We urgently need to build opposition locally and nationally to austerity, cuts and the cost of living crisis.</p>
<p>Dave was a socialist Labour MP from 1983 to 1992 in Coventry. Labour expelled him, along with many other socialists, for helping organise mass non- payment of Maggie Thatcher's hated Poll Tax.</p>

<p>The Tory and Labour establishment hated Dave because he refused to take the excessive MP's salary. Instead, he took the same wage as a local skilled factory worker – he was a workers' MP on a worker's wage. If Dave is elected, he will do the same today.</p>

<p>From 1998 to 2012, Dave was a Socialist Party councillor in Coventry. While Labour started privatising our NHS, our public housing, schools and services and launched illegal wars for oil, Dave as a fighting socialist gave a fighting voice for ordinary working-class people.</p>

<p>When Labour in Birmingham attacked our bin and homecare workers, Dave and TUSC supporters helped mobilise support nationally to help them win.</p>
<p>Dave is the national chair of the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition (TUSC), a Socialist Party member and has been involved in numerous campaigns for both over the years. An archive of his written works is available <a href="https://www.socialistparty.org.uk/keyword/Dave_Nellist">here</a>.</p>
		
<p>TUSC is a coalition of the RMT rail and transport union, the Socialist Party, Resist and other socialists. It enables trade unionists, community campaigners and socialists to stand together against the pro-austerity establishment parties. It is a beginning - a step towards the kind of party we need to deliver a socialist alternative to austerity.</p>

<p><b>Cost of living crisis is hammering people like us - Erdington can’t go on like this anymore.</b></p>

<p>They say inflation is 5%. Not for ordinary people it isn’t!</p>
<p>Essential foods up over 20%, energy bills are soaring and bills for services or tuition fees are becoming impossible - yet last year, just ten billionaires increased their income by £402 billion. That is four hundred and two thousand million!</p>

<p>Working-class families and communities in Birmingham have been thrown under the bus for years now. While expensive luxury apartments shoot up in the city centre, social housing declines.</p>

<p>We've still got tower blocks with Grenfell-style cladding across the city, waiting for a disaster to happen. The Tory government and Labour Council lack the will to effectively combat dodgy and exploitative landlords. How many councillors and MPs are also landlords?</p>

<p>Dave and TUSC campaigners have campaigned tirelessly against rogue landlords and for repair of all social housing so everyone can feel secure in their homes. Long term empty properties in the city should be brought under public ownership to combat the housing crisis and homelessness.</p>
<p>Nor do we just want to defend the scraps the government and council have left us. We fight to stop all cuts but also return to public ownership all the valuable services sold off, closed and abandoned over the years.</p>
<p>Bring back all the public nurseries and free child care. Bring back all the youth centres, sports clubs, libraries, swimming pools and more that have been stolen.</p>

<p>We fight for £15 an hour and an end to zero-hour contracts.</p>
<p>Vanity projects like the Commonwealth Games will not fill the massive holes left in communities of vital services being ripped out. We absolutely want more access to sports and exercise facilities, but from the bottom up, not this top-down corporate approach. We need community sports facilities, not PR stunts.</p>

<p>Dave says:</p>
<p style="margin-left:20px"><i>The gap between the rich and the rest has never been wider - and the gap between the establishment parties has never been narrower. Working people need a new party that stands up for them. And a new way of running the economy to benefit the majority, not the billionaires. In this rich country, everyone should be able to afford a warm home, a well-paid job, free education and health... If the system can't afford that, we need to change the system along socialist lines to one that works for us!</i></p>

<p><b>GKN CLOSURE DISGRACE</b></p>
<p>The devastating closure of the GKN plant and the 500 plus skilled jobs that will be gutted and stolen from Erdington is a disgrace. The government could have intervened, nationalised and saved GKN, but they let it go to the wall. Labour said next to nothing, not even demanding nationalisation.</p>

<p>Dave Nellist calls for nationalisation under democratic working-class control and management - to save jobs and keep skills in Birmingham.</p>		
		
<p><b>Dave Campaigns for...</b></p>
